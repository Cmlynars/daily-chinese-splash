			 <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
			 <p>
				<strong>Why isn't the sound working?</strong>
			</p> 
			<p>
				If you are using a Samsung device, this issue is likely being caused by your phone's test-to-speech engine. Go into your phone's settings, find the "Language & Input" section, and tap the "Text-to-speech" option. Then change your desired TTS engine from Samsung Text-to-speech Engine to Google Text-to-speech Engine.
			</p> 
			<p>
				If you are using an iPhone, this issue is likely being caused by your phone's ringer being "off". Please toggle the switch on the left side of your phone to turn your ringer "on".
			</p>
			<p>
				We are working on a permanent fix for both of these issues.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>I'm in China, why isn't the app working for me?</strong>
			</p> 
			<p class="large-space">
				Unfortunately, because of government restrictions, certain integrations that are used by Daily Chinese do not function in China. However, you are still able to use the app by accessing a VPN. We are working on a long-term fix for this problem.
